# App Store and Google Play Store Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves cleaning and performing analysis on datasets from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The goal is to understand trends, identify popular genres, and gain insights into app ratings and installations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning**: This involves processing the raw data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.

2. **Data Analysis**: This section includes various analyses to extract meaningful insights from the cleaned data. Analyses include:
   - Identifying popular genres based on average ratings and installs.
   - Visualizing data through charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, treemaps).
   - Comparing trends between the two platforms.

3. **Visualization**: This part of the project involves creating visual representations of the data to better understand the trends and patterns. Tools like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Squarify are used for creating visualizations.

## Data Sources

- **Apple App Store**: Data includes app ratings, reviews, genres, and install counts.
- **Google Play Store**: Data includes similar metrics for apps available on the Google Play Store.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Squarify
- Kaleido (for saving Plotly charts as images)

## Usage

To run the analysis and generate visualizations, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

2. **Run the Data Cleaning Script**:

3. **Run the Data Analysis Script**:

4. **Generate Visualizations**:

## Results

The results of the analysis will include various charts and graphs that highlight key insights from the data, such as the most popular genres, average app ratings, and installation trends across both platforms.
